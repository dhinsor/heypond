This is a markdown site built for writers, developers, and teams who want a fast, real-time publishing workflow.

## What makes it different

Most static site generators require a rebuild every time you publish. This one does not. Write markdown, run a sync command, and your content appears instantly across all connected browsers.

The backend runs on Convex, a reactive database that pushes updates to clients in real time. No polling. No cache invalidation. No deploy cycles for content changes.

## The stack

| Layer    | Technology         |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript |
| Backend  | Convex             |
| Styling  | CSS variables      |
| Hosting  | Netlify            |
| Content  | Markdown           |

## Who this is for

Writers who want version control for their content. Developers who want to extend the platform. Teams who need real-time collaboration without a traditional CMS.

Fork it, customize it, ship it.
